# Prince-Of-Persia

## Project Descrption
This project was created with the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with JavaScript. In level 6, we were required to manipulate the code to guide the character through the maze, then collect each potion. To facilitate the collection of potions in the code, we conducted a kata exercise for each one individually to manipulate them. Once all potions are collected, the character can save the princess. The questions for each potion can be seen in the console. In level 7, we had to find a method for the character to reach the princess without touching the fire walls.

## Run
You can start the next levels of the game using the node start.js level6, node start.js level7, and node start.js level8 commands. You need to manually stop these commands using Ctrl + C before running another command. To access to the page in the browser, the commands need to be run again.
